🌟 **About Me**  </br>
Hi! I’m **_Vir_** — a developer who loves turning simple ideas into smart, interactive web apps. I believe in **learning by building**, and I’m currently on a journey to master both frontend and backend technologies.  
My dev journey is fueled by **daily coding, DSA challenges, UI design, and full-stack experimentation**. If I'm not solving a problem, I'm probably creating one... just to solve it! 😉

🔍 Always exploring →  
- How to make UIs that feel alive 🎨  
- How backend logic powers the frontend 🧩  
- How to stay consistent no matter what 🧘
